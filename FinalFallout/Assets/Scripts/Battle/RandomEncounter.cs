/*
 * Uses animation curves to customize battle chances based on biomes over times the player has moved
 * 
 * Essentially you customize your curve to be however you want, and when evaluated at "lookAt" it will tell
 * you the value of the curve at that time. So the Overworld has a slow increase until the end where it spikes up.
 * Comare this value to a random generated number to see if it's lower and you have a random encounter generator
